# A pass is an attempt by a pilot at landing at a carrier. A pass can result in
# either a trap (where a wire is caught and the airplane stops) or a miss. A
# miss is either a bolter (where the aircraft touches down on the deck but does
# not catch a wire, or does not stop after catching a wire) or a waveoff (where
# the aircraft is commanded by the LSO to reject the approach). A waveoff can be
# a technique waveoff (caused by poor pilot technique), a foul-deck waveoff
# (which is not the fault of the pilot), or an own waveoff (where the pilot
# elects to reject the approach without having been told to do so by the LSO).
#
# Each pass is given a grade, depending on the quality of the pilot's approach.
# The grades for a trap are, from best to worst: `_OK_`, `OK`, `(OK)`, `â€”`, and
# `C`. If the pilot waves off, the grade would be `WO` or `OWO`. A bolter would
# be graded as `B`.
#
# These grades all have associated scores. `_OK_` is five points, down to `C`
# which is zero points. A wave-off is 1 point and a bolter is 2.5 points.
# Foul-deck waveoffs do not count towards the point total. Own waveoffs are at
# the discretion of the LSO.
#
# To that end, this model calculates scores automatically, but all scores and
# other values can be adjusted by the LSO.
#
# Along with calculating score, this model also calculates squadron boarding
# rate. Boarding rate is the fraction of successful traps compared to the total
# number of qualifying passes. Only some passes are used as part of the boarding
# rate calculation. (For example, a foul-deck waveoff would not help or hurt
# boarding rate.)
#
# Passes should typically be associated with a Pilot, but not all dcs.log files
# properly record which pilots flew which passes. To that end, it is possible to
# have passes not associated with any pilot. The website user has the
# opportunity to properly assign these unassigned passes after the logfile is
# uploaded.
#
# Associations
# ------------
#
# | `squadron` | The {Squadron} this pass belongs to. |
# | `pilot` | The {Pilot} that flew this pass (or `nil` if the logfile processor was unable to determine the pilot). |
#
# Properties
# ----------
# | `time` | The UTC time when the pass was flown. |
# | `ship_name` | The name of the aircraft carrier the pass was flown for. |
# | `aircraft_type` | The type of aircraft flown. This must match the DCS internal name for the aircraft (as used in the `Input` directory) to properly link to the front-end image. |
# | `grade` | The pass grade (such as "fair"). |
# | `score` | The point score for the pass (such as 3.0). |
# | `trap` | `true` if this pass counts in favor of boarding rate, `false` if it counts against, or `nil` if it doesn't apply to boarding rate. |
# | `wire` | Which wire was caught. |
# | `notes` | Additional LSO notes. Typically formatted using the standard LSO shorthand. |
